Question 2:
	Now x and y are being added together as doubles, which means 4.5 and 5.5 are not losing 
	their decimals.  But sum is still a int, as seen from the warnings, which explains why the 
	averages are not working out; decimal is being dropped.  Changing sum to a double, should 
	fix warnings and remain math issues.
