#To see all the (hw) features I've implemented, please see the included
#PDF files (hw04, hw05, hw06). There is nothing checked off for hw06, but
#some of the requirements from the website should be met
#
#Highlighted features are implemented. Red text are exceptions. Unhighlighted
#are probably not implemented, unless they are trivial. Sorry, tried to update
#this religiously!
#
#Thanks!
