of where animals may be in a habitat, based off of where they had been 
previously. Using Brownian Bridges created a method to do this. Although the 
resulting maps told researches where animals would be, it didn't make any 
direct relations with habitat. The research involves calculations over many locations, which is easily parallelizable.

Horne and associate then moved on to the Synoptic Model for tieing animal 
movement to habitat covariates. From this, any observed animal's behaviors 
could be predicted by its habitat. This lead to current work the author is 
involved with to tie the Brownian Bridge and Synoptic Model together. The
result is a hugely paralellizable application.

James is a strong proponent of interdisciplinary efforts like IBEST, and has
given many talks about the intersect of science and technology. He has degrees
and background in both, and is a great personal source for many scientific
processes and technologies.

\section{Workplan}

Parallel Concepts create the basis of understanding the entire project. 
Parallel Concepts will then be applied in simple version of Parallel 
Programming. Once the project has shown concepts implemented in code, the 
research will then focus on taking real world algorithms, and making the same
transfer to parallelism. 

The research will then go on to explain the foundation of parallel programming,
the HPC Cluster. Once completed, the reader will have a solid understanding 
from concepts to implementation, all the way to the HPC Operating System.

Next, the project will talk about how to measure performance of algorithms,
and how to profile software. It will then help readers identify when software
it is appropriate for parallelism.

Finally, the research would summarize everything with explaining Software
Lifecycles. More specifically, how to plan large scale computing projects, 
and how to develop software for HPC / parallel environments.

\section{Statement of Qualifications}
This research project is a collection of tutorials, write up, and general 
thoughts collected in 2+ years working in the University of Idaho IBEST 
Computing Core. It is also information collected and researched in NCMGRP, a
research project lead by Ph. D. student Adam Wells at the University of Idaho 
College of Natural Resources. 

This project content may be included in the final report
in NCMGRP (Northwest Cascades Mountain Goat Research Project), and will 
hopefully be distributed to users of the IBEST Core, as well as to potential 
projects in CNR. The information in the report will be directly cited or 
indirectly sourced from James Foster (IBEST, Co-founder) and Rob Lyon (IBEST,
Lead System Administrator), Adam Wells (UI CNR Ph. D. student), Jon Horne 
(UI CNR), and others within the author's research interests.

This research project is part of the bigger NCMGRP research project. This is
the first funded university research project the author has directly been 
involved with. The research project may have big implication on what research
the author does for graduate studies, if pursued. The author has spent years 
in one realm or another of environment modeling. The computer science 
portion that is the core of this research is the collection of a lot of previos
efforts.

Once this research is completed, research could be continued in the form of 
Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent agents can simulate the behaviors of these
animals in habitat. Modelling habitats, however, takes a lot of computation,
and would be intractable without good practices in HPC and parallel computing.


\section{Conclusion}
The NSF should fund this project, because it is fundemental to establishing 
more successful projects. Many current projects are lacking, because they do
not have the research that would be conducted in this project. This project
will identify and lay the framework for how to process large amounts of 
scientific data. This is a problem that fundamentally affects almost all
current scientific research, but is also one of the least defined areas.
Computer literacy must increase if science will answere the questions of today,
and this project will help achieve that.
