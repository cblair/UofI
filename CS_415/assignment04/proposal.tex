I'd like to propose a project to simulate mountain goat spatial use in the Northern Cascade Mountains. I am currently in a research project that takes their gps locations, along with many habitat covariates in the traveled area. A brownian bridge algorithm is used to determine observable habitat per location, and multiple synoptic models are optimized to determine which sets of covariates affect future movement. Mountain goats in the Northern Cascades tend to let talus and slope in terrain determine most of their movement, and would be a good simulation. 
 
The project, NCMGRP, is lead by a Ph.D. student at the UI CNR. I can get you more information if you like. I have actually been thinking about this idea for a long time, and would really like to someday simulate these animals with AI. But for now, I'll do some simple stuff with StarLogo or V6.
